  <p>I take my secondary school at Madrasah Al-Aminiah, Pulau Pinang from 
	Form 1 until Form 5. That place holds a lot of memories for me, both sweet
	and bitter. Most of my school memories were built there, especially during 
	my SPM years. During school era, I learned more about Islam subjects such 
	as tasawwur, aqidah, tauhid, tafsir, and many others. These subjects helped 
	shape my understanding and gave me valuable lessons beyond academics.
    At the same time, I found my comfort circle, which is my close friends. 
	They were the people who made my school life more meaningful and enjoyable.
	I shared many moments with them, from stress to laughter. People always say
	that school memories can never be replaced, and honestly, I agree with that.
	I truly miss my friends, teachers, and the moments I spent during my school years there.</p>

    <p>My diploma era was the beginning of my journey in university life. I took 
	a Diploma in Information Management at UiTM Kedah. At the start, everything 
	felt new and a bit scary, but day by day I slowly learned how to adapt and 
	survive in this new phase. Throughout my diploma journey, I learned many important 
	things such as how to gain confidence, manage my time properly, communicate better,
	and mix with different types of people. These lessons were not only from classes,
	but also from real experiences and challenges along the way.During this diploma, 
	I met many good friends who stayed with me through ups and downs. We struggled together,
	laughed together, and supported each other when things got tough. This journey is honestly 
	filled with meaningful and unforgettable memories. I am kind of sad knowing that my 
	diploma is coming to an end, and this is my last semester with them. I really wish all 
	my friend’s success in their future paths, and I hope everyone stays safe and takes good 
	care of themselves after we graduate. This diploma era will always have a special place in my heart.</p>
