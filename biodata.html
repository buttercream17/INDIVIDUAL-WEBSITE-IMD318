                            <p style="font-size: 20px;text-align: justify">Hi! My name is Yasmin Safiah Binti Mohammad Marzuki 🐣.Most people call me Yasmin,while some prefer Safiah,
							   and I don’t really mind as long as it’s my name.I’m someone who values me time because it helps me recharge 
						       my energy and clear my thoughts.I consider myself a simple person who enjoys living at my own pace.I believe 
							   that simplicity makes life feel calmer and more meaningful.I enjoy taking life at my own pace and appreciating 
							   small moments in my daily routine.This website is a small space where I share a little about myself, 
							   my experiences, and my personal journey.</p>

                            <h4>THINGS I LOVE 🌼</h4>
							
							<p>I really love nature. I like the sound of nature, the smell of fresh air,
							   and seeing green views around me.Being in nature makes me feel calm, comfortable,
  							   and at peace.One of the activities I enjoy is hiking. Even if I’m not hiking,
							   I still like to walk around and look at nature, like rivers, the sea, or mountains.
							   I enjoy just walking and observing the surroundings.I also like reading novels. 
							   Reading novels helps me escape from reality for a while and forget about daily life,
							   even just for a short time.Another thing I enjoy is making desserts. I do cook sometimes,
							   but I prefer making desserts because they are easier to make and fun for me. All of these 
							   things help me relax and enjoy life in a simple way.</p>
							
                        </div>

                            <h4>PERSONALITY 🙎🏻‍♀️</h4>
							
							<p>I’m the kind of person who likes to observe people first before getting close to them. 
							It doesn’t mean I’m picky when it comes to friendships but I’m actually comfortable being friends 
							with all kinds of people. I just prefer to understand someone before fully opening up.
                            Another personality about me is I can be quite sensitive, but that doesn’t mean I can’t accept 
							advice from anyone. I appreciate honest reminders and see them as a way to grow and improve myself. 
							I’m more of a listener than a talker, and I like observing things around me before I speak. 
							However, once I feel comfortable, I can be quite talkative, just not with everyone. I open up more with 
							people I feel safe and comfortable around. So at the end of the day, everyone has their own personality, 
							and this is just me.</p>

                        <div class="table-column"class="section-title"style="font-family: Georgia, serif">
                            <h4>PERSONAL DISLIKES 🙅🏼‍♀️</h4>
							
							<p>I don’t like people who are not honest, especially liars. For me, lying is one of the main reasons
							why people start to lose trust. I believe being honest is always better than lying, even though sometimes 
							it takes time to accept the truth. I also dislike crowded places. Crowded environments are usually very loud 
							and chaotic. I don’t like places that are too noisy because they can easily spoil my mood and make me feel 
							uncomfortable. Besides that, I don’t really like unnecessary drama or negative energy. I prefer simple and
							peaceful situations rather than problems that could be avoided. These are some things that I try to avoid
							in my daily life. </p>
